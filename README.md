# js-utilities

I've been working on Javascript/Typescript for a decade or so, and this is some utilities that I have created between these years and often used in my daily tasks.

Although the library is so-called js-utilities, I actually use Typescript from day one, so the source codes are implemented in Typescript as well.

Since I'm a frontend engineer, these utilities should be considered browser specific, because I have not tested any of these utilities in any environment other than browsers. And if there are any optimization techniques involved, they are browser specific too.

To use these utilities, simply copy the content and paste them into a new ts file, they do not need an extra compilation to work. Event if there are some type errors, they should be easily fixed according to your Typescript versions.
